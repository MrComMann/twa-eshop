                <p class="pb-2">At HEADUCT, we're not just a company. We're innovators at the forefront of headwear
                    fashion and technology. Founded by a team of passionate designers and tech enthusiasts, we embarked
                    on a mission to revolutionize the way people think about headgear.</p>
                <p>Our journey began with a simple question:
                    <span class="italic">Why does headwear have to be mundane?</span> This led us down the
                    path of creativity and innovation, crafting a line of products that are not only stylish but also
                    infused with cutting-edge technology.
